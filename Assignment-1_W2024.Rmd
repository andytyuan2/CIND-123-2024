Use RStudio for this assignment. Complete the assignment by inserting your  \texttt{R} code wherever you see the string "#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE".

When you click the **Knit** button, a document (PDF, Word, or HTML format) will be generated that includes both the assignment content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks.

**NOTE**: YOU SHOULD NEVER HAVE `install.packages` IN YOUR CODE; OTHERWISE, THE `Knit` OPTION WILL GIVE AN ERROR. COMMENT OUT ALL PACKAGE INSTALLATIONS.

Submit **both**  the `rmd` and generated `output` files. Failing to submit both files will be subject to mark deduction. The output file has to be made using the `knit` button as explained in the class. PDF or HTML is preferred. 

## Sample Question and Solution

Use `seq()` to create the vector $(3,5\ldots,29)$.

```{r}
seq(3, 30, 2)
seq(3, 29, 2)
```

## Question 1 (32 points)

## Q1a (8 points)
Create and print a vector `x` with all odd numbers from 5 to 120 and a vector `y` containing multiples of 5 in the same range. 

HINT: use seq() function. Calculate the sum of lengths of the vectors `x` and `y`.

HINT: use length()

```{r}
# Insert your answer here.
x <- seq(5, 120, by = 2)
x
y <- seq(5, 120, by = 5)
y
sum(length(x), length(y))
```

## Q1b (8 points)
Create a new vector, `y_cube`, with the cube of elements at indices 2, 4, 6, 10, 15, 18, 21, and 25 from the variable `y`. 

HINT: Use indexing rather than a `for` loop. Calculate the mean and median of the LAST five values from `y_cube`.
```{r}
# Insert your answer here.
y_cube <- c(y[2]^3, y[4]^3, y[6]^3, y[10]^3, y[15]^3, y[18]^3, y[21]^3, y[25]^3)
y_cube
mean(tail(y_cube,5), na.rm=T)
median(tail(y_cube,5), na.rm=T)
```

## Q1c (8 points)
For a given factor variable `factorVar <- factor(c("2.5", "7.1", "6.3", "4.8"))`, would it be correct to use the following commands to convert factor to number?

`as.numeric(factorVar)`

If not, explain your answer and provide the correct one.

```{r}
# Insert your answer here.
factorVar <- factor(c("2.5", "7.1", "6.3", "4.8"))
as.numeric(factorVar)
is.numeric(as.numeric(factorVar))
# Yes it is correct to use that function to convert factor to number
```

## Q1d (8 points)
A comma-separated values file `dataset.csv` consists of missing values represented by Not A Number (`null`) and question mark (`?`). How can you read this type of files in R? 

**NOTE**: Please make sure you have saved the `dataset.csv` file at your current working directory.

Print the head of the file to ensure everything is correct.

```{r}
# Insert your answer here.
dataset <- read.csv("dataset.csv")
head(dataset)
```

# Question 2 (32 points)

## Q2a (8 points)
Compute: $$\sum_{n=4}^{25}\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{(2n+1)!}$$

HINT: Use `factorial(n)` to compute $n!$.

```{r}
# Insert your answer here.
first_numbers <- 4:25
applied_calculation <- ((-1)^(first_numbers +1)) / factorial(2*first_numbers + 1)
sum_of_first_numbers <- sum(applied_calculation)
sum_of_first_numbers
```

## Q2b (8 points)
Compute: $$\prod_{n=2}^{6} \left(3n + \frac{2}{3^n} \right)$$
NOTE: The symbol $\Pi$ represents multiplication.
```{r}
# Insert your answer here.
pi_notation <- 2:6
function_numbers <- pi_notation*3 + 2/(3^pi_notation)
product = prod(function_numbers)
product
```

### Q2a and Q2b Guidance
For Q2a and Q2b, you'll need to apply basic mathematical concepts in R. Don't worry if we haven't covered a similar exact problem in class. If you understand how to code in R and the basic math operations (like factorial, powers, sums, and products), you're all set!

Example for Understanding:
Let's start with a simpler example:
Compute the sum of the first 5 square numbers. In mathematical terms, this is:

$$\sum_{n=1}^{5}{(n)^{2}}$$
 

which translates to $1^2+2^2+3^2+4^2+5^2$.

In R, you could solve this by:
```{r}
numbers <- 1:5          # Create a vector of numbers 1 to 5
squared_numbers <- numbers^2  # Square each element of the vector
sum_squares <- sum(squared_numbers)  # Sum up the squared numbers
sum_squares
```

Now, come back to Q2a and Q2b. Your task in those questions is similar. You'll use loops to iterate over a range of numbers, applying the specified mathematical operations at each step. Remember to use built-in R functions like `factorial()`, `sum()`, and `prod()` when needed.

In **Q2a**, you'll be computing a sum, but each term involves a factorial and a power. Remember, R can perform these operations on entire vectors.

In **Q2b**, you'll be computing a product, and each term is a simple arithmetic expression involving numbers and powers.


## Q2c (8 points)
Describe what the following R command does:
`rep(1:3, each = 2)[NA]`
```{r}
# Insert your answer here.
# this command will give the NA values of the repetition of the vector 1:3, with each element being repeated twice. The output will be a vector of 6 NAs.

rep(1:3, each = 2)[NA]
```

## Q2d (8 points)
Describe the purpose of `is.logical()`, `is.character()`, `is.numeric()`, and `is.na()` functions? Please use `x <- c("a", FALSE, "b", NA, 2, TRUE)` to explain your description.
```{r}
# Insert your answer here.
x <- c("a", FALSE, "b", NA, 2, TRUE)

# is.logical() function is to check if the argument is a logical data type. This typically means a vector or matrix of TRUEs and FALSEs. If you evaluate the vector x, then you will get FALSE since not the entire vector is logical.
is.logical(x)

# similarly the is.character() function checks if any element of the argument is a character data type. This typically means a set of strings. The vector x will be TRUE if you use the is.character() function.
is.character(x)

# the is.numeric() function will evaluate if the entire argument is numeric or not. In the case of x, it will return as false.
is.numeric(x)

# the is.na() functin will tell you which of the elements in the argument is an NA value. In the case of x, it will output a vector of TRUE and FALSE, with the TRUE being where the NA is in the vector.
is.na(x)
```

# Question 3 (36 points)
The `airquality` dataset contains daily air quality measurements in New York from May to September 1973. The variables include Ozone level, Solar radiation, wind speed, temperature in Fahrenheit, month, and day. Please see the detailed description using `help("airquality")`.

Install the `airquality` data set on your computer using the command `install.packages("datasets")`. Then load the `datasets` package into your session.
```{r}
library(datasets)
```

## Q3a (4 points)
Display the last 10 rows of the `airquality` data set.
```{r}
# Insert your answer here.
tail(airquality, 10)
```

## Q3b (8 points)
Compute the median of the first four variables (Ozone, Solar.R, Wind and Temp) for the fifth month using the `sapply()` function.

HINT: You might need to consider removing the `NA` values; otherwise, the median will not be computed. 
```{r}
# Insert your answer here.
sapply(airquality[airquality$Month == 5, 1:4], median, na.rm = T)
```

## Q3c (8 points)
Construct two boxplots for the `Ozone ` and `Solar.R` variables.
Then, compute the values of all outliers which lie beyond the whiskers.
```{r}
# Insert your answer here.
boxplot(airquality$Ozone)
boxplot(airquality$Solar.R)
# only outliers for the ozone box plot
boxplot(airquality$Ozone, plot = FALSE)$out
boxplot(airquality$Solar.R, plot = FALSE)$out
```

## Q3d (8 points)
Compute the lower quartile of the `Temp` variable with two different methods.

HINT: Only show the lower quartile using indexing.
For the type of quartile, please see https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.6.2/topics/quantile.
```{r}
# Insert your answer here.
quantile(airquality$Temp)[2]
sort(airquality$Temp, decreasing = FALSE)[length(airquality$Temp)/4]

```

## Q3e (8 points)
Construct a bar chart to describe the number of entries by `Month`.

HINT: use the `table()` function to count and tabulate the number of entries within a `Month`.

Don't forget to name each axis and have a title for the plot.

```{r}
# Insert your answer here.
month_bar <- table(airquality$Month)
barplot(month_bar, xlab = "Month", ylab = "Frequency of Entries", main = "Entries of Air Quality by Month")
```
