## Question 1 [15 Pts]

a) [5 Pts] Midterm and final grades of some students are given as c(87, 72, 80, 91, 85, 96, 40, 34, 61) and c(59, 68, 52, 62, 78, 70, 35, 28, 45). Set R variables `midterm` and `final` respectively. Then find the least-squares line relating the final to the midterm. 

   Does the assumption of a linear relationship appear to be reasonable in this case? Give reasons to your answer as a comment.
```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE.
midterm <- c(87, 72, 80, 91, 85, 96, 40, 34, 61)
final <- c(59, 68, 52, 62, 78, 70, 35, 28, 45)

plot(final, midterm)
lm(formula = midterm ~ final)
abline(lm(midterm  ~ final))

# I think the linear relationship is reasonable here
  # blah blah blah
  # COME BACK TO THIS
```

b) [5 Pts] Plot the final as a function of the midterm using a scatterplot and graph the least-square line in red color on the same plot. 
```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE.

plot(midterm, final, main = "Final score as a function of the midterm")
abline(lm(final ~ midterm), col = "red")
text(x = 60, y = 35, "final = 8.2940 + 0.6538midterm")
```

c) [5 Pts] Use the regression line to predict the final grades when the midterm grades are 83 and 22. 
```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE.
8.2940 + 0.6538*83 # 62.5594 final grade projected
8.2940 + 0.6538*22 # 22.6776 final grade projected

# COME BACK TO THIS QUESTION
```



## Question 2 [45 Pts]

This question makes use of package "plm". Please load Crime dataset as follows:
```{r load_packages}
#install.packages("plm")
library(plm) 
data(Crime)
```

a) [5 Pts] Display the first 7 rows of 'crime' data and display the names of all the variables, the number of variables, then display a descriptive summary of each variable. 
```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE.
head(Crime, 7)

names(Crime)

ncol(Crime)

for (i in (1:ncol(Crime)))
 print(summary(Crime[,i]))


```

b) [5 Pts] Calculate the mean,variance and standard deviation of probability of conviction (prbconv) by omitting the missing values, if any. 
```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE.
mean(Crime$prbconv, na.rm = T)
var(Crime$prbconv, na.rm = T)
sd(Crime$prbconv, na.rm = T)
```
c) [5 Pts] Use `lpolpc` (log-police per capita) and `smsa` variables to build a linear regression model to predict probability of conviction (prbconv).  And, compare with another linear regression model that uses `polpc` (police per capita) and `smsa`.

   [5 Pts] How can you draw a conclusion from the results? 
   (Note: Full marks requires comment on the predictors)
```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE.
# SMSA is a factor that is either yes or no to if the individual lives in a standard metro statistical area
crime1 <- lm(prbconv ~ lpolpc + smsa, data = Crime)
summary(crime1)

# P value in the summary is less than 0.05, which means it is significant. The log police per capita has a 1.2049 estimate against the probability of conviction, while the smsa has a -0.7827 estimate of slope against the probability of conviction. This seems to suggest that when there are more convictions made when the log police per capita is higher. Meanwhile, smsa's coefficient with the probability of conviction suggests that there may be other factors that should be pulled into consideration when evaluating probability of conviction in an urban or rural area. R squared is only 0.1391, which means the linear model may be a poor to moderate fit to the data.


crime2 <- lm(prbconv ~ polpc + smsa, data = Crime)
summary(crime2)

# P value in this model is also below 0.05, which means it is significant. polpc has a much steeper relation with the probability of conviction than the first model, which suggests that it may be a better representation of how the probability of conviction increases when police per capita increases. It also has a similarly small value for smsa to probability of conviction, suggesting that smsa is not something that affects probability of conviction very much. Furthermore, the R squared of this model is 0.2053, suggesting a better fit of the linear model to the data.


```

d) [5 Pts] Based on the output of your model, predict the output for different factors of `smsa` when `polpc` is set to 0.0025. Use both the predict function and intercept and slope equations and compare the results. 
```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE.
intercept <- 0.19444
coefficient_polpc <- 278.52397
smsacoefficientyes <- -0.44656



data_predict <- data.frame(polpc = c(0.0025, 0.0025), smsa = factor(c("no", "yes"), levels = c("no", "yes")))

predict_0.0025 <- predict(crime2, newdata = data_predict)
predict_0.0025
# Predicts the probability of conviction when polpc is set to 0.0025 for both smsa factors (2 = Yes and 1 = No)



```
e) [5 Pts] Find Pearson correlation between probability of prison sentence `prbpris` and tax per capita `taxpc`; and also Pearson correlation between probability of conviction `prbconv` and probability of arrest `prbarr`. 

   [5 Pts] What conclusions can you draw? Write your reasons as comments.
```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE.
cor.test(Crime$prbpris, Crime$taxpc)
# There is a small negative linear relation between the probability of prison sentence and tax per capita, suggesting that the probability of a prison sentence goes down when the area the crime is in pays higher taxes per person. Additionally, the p-value is small, which supports a significant finding that is against the expected correlation of 0. However, this correlation is comparatively small, so the taxes per capita likely does not solely influence the probability of a prison sentence.

cor.test(Crime$prbconv, Crime$prbarr)
# There is a small correlation between probability of conviction and probability of arrest, which seems to suggest a minimal linear relation between the two. Furthermore, the p-value is rather large, which suggests this finding is not significant, again supporting that there is a minimal linear relation between the two variables. It appears that being arrested doesn't necessarily mean you will be convicted.
```

f) [5 Pts] Display the correlation matrix of the variables: prbconv, prbpris, density, polpc. 

   [5 Pts] Write what conclusion you can draw, as comments. 
   
```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE.
cor_matrix <- data.frame(Crime$prbconv, Crime$prbpris, Crime$density, Crime$polpc)
cor(cor_matrix)

# There is a high positive correlation of police per capita and probability of conviction. This appears to suggest that if there are more police per capita, which means more possible authoritative eyes on crime, the more likely one is convicted. However, there is a distinction that this is not causation. the higher correlation is indicative of the more likely chance of being caught when there are more police in the area. Crime does NOT suddenly spike when police are present, nor are police more likely to convict if there are more of them.
```




## Question 3 [15 Pts]

This question makes use of package "ISwR". Please load `airquality` dataset as following:

```{r}
# or install.packages("ISwR")
library(ISwR) 
data(airquality)
str(airquality)
```


a) [5 Pts] Plot a histogram to assess the normality of the `Ozone` variable, then explain why it does not appear normally distributed. 
```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE.
hist(airquality$Ozone)

# the ozone variable does not appear to be normally distributed. The mode, median, and mean do not appear to be centered. 

# 
```

b) [5 Pts] Create a boxplot that shows the distribution of `Ozone` in each month. Use different colors for each month. 

```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE.
boxplot(airquality$Ozone ~ airquality$Month, ylab = "Ozone values", xlab = "Months of the year", main = "Ozone boxplots in months of the year", col = c("blue", "red", "green", "yellow", "purple"), na.rm = T)
```

c) [5 Pts] Create a matrix of scatterplots of all the numeric variables in the `airquality` dataset (i.e. Ozone, Solar.R, Wind and Temp.)
(Hint: investigate pairs() function) 

```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE.
air <- subset(airquality, select = -c(Month, Day))
pairs(air,labels = c("Ozone", " Solar.R", "Wind", "Temp"))
```



## Question 4 [25 Pts]

Many times in data analysis, we need a method that relies on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. The underlying concept is to use randomness to solve problems. In fact,  this is a mathematical technique, which is used to estimate the possible outcomes of an uncertain event and is called the *Monte Carlo Method*. 

Consider that We roll a die 10 times and we want to know the probability of getting more than 3 times of even numbers. This is a problem for the Binomial distribution, but suppose we don't know anything about Binomial distribution. We can easily solve this problem with a Monte Carlo Simulation.   


a) [5 Pts] The Monte Carlo Method uses random numbers to simulate some process. Here the process is rolling a die 20 times. Assume the die is fair. What is the probability of success or getting an even number in rolling the die once?
```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE.
dice <- function() {
  roll <- sample(1:6, size = 1, replace = TRUE)
  if (roll %% 2 == 0) {
    return(1)
  } else {
    return(0)
  }
}

results <- replicate(1000, dice())
mean(results)

# The probability of getting an even number is approximately 0.5
```


b) [10 Pts] Define a function named `one.trial`, that simulates a single round of rolling a die 20 times and returns true if the number of even numbers is > 5.
```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE.

```

c) [5 pts] Repeat the function `one.trial` for `N = 100,000` times and sum up the outcomes and store the result in a variable named `desired.output`. Compute the probability of getting more than 5 times of even numbers by using relative frequency. 

```{r}


```

d) [5 pts] Use the Binomial formula you learned before to calculate such probability and Compare it with the probability value obtained in part (c).

```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE.

```

Congratulations! you have completed the first run of the Monte Carlo simulation. 

If there is further interest, put all the above logic in a function, and call it 50 times at least, and store the results in a vector called Prob then take the mean of Prob vector to be more accurate.
